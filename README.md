# ECE-606-Algorithm-Design-Analysis

In this repository I have added the solutions of the assignments given in the course ECE 606: Algorithm Design and Analysis that I took in Fall 2024. They might not be all correct and I have removed the questions as I don't have the right to put them in this repository.
The topics involved :

- Intro to the course; intro to Python 3; Expressing algorithms

- Data structures - graphs, trees, lists.

- Properties of algorithms: existence, correctness, efficiency

- Design strategy I: incremental

- Design strategy II: divide-n-conquer

- Design strategy III: greedy

- Design strategy IV: dynamic programming

- Randomization, Probabilistic and approximation algorithms

- Non-determinism; computational complexity; the class NP; other complexity classes

- Cook- and Karp-reductions; hardness and completeness for a complexity class

- NP-complete problems and reductions
